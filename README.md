# Neural-Network-from-scratch
A simple neural network I built from scratch in python to understand the architecture and fundamentals of feed-forward and back-propagation. These concepts were learnt in the Stanford Machine Learning Course 


#### Downloading the Package

Download the virtualenv that contains the project. And activate it with the command below: 

```source bin/activate```

To access the source code look at the NeuralNetwork.py for commented explanatory code on how a neural network works. Look at the main.py file to use the script.
